erm, should we really be booting from start.sh?
not really, it should have a boot kernel, but those get complex
hmm, yep
oh and by the way
ah true, cause we can just do that with boot.py!
you dont have to use requirements.txt to install packages
yep!
yes, also, we need to have an installer for this XD for things like my old ht-os, it had a custom installer that took an hour to setup the boot system
try 'pip install PACKAGENAME --user', the --user prfix installs locally.
it was in nodejs/c++, we can try....
but it will take a lot of time, and learning C
can we recreate it?, 
i'ma start to learn c so i can make a boot kernel :D
https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp, learning C++.
what if we edit the .bashrc file to run on startup?
luckily, i have emailed support through my school email. So it should be unsuspended soon.
